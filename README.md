# Blackjack
Blackjack terminal game as the final project for CS101 at Codeacademy

Splitting might never be implemented into the game, as its complexity goes beyond the scope and intentions for this project.
If and when I implement splitting, the game will be released in it's full version as v1.0

For now, I'm done with it, and I'll move on with my studies.
