# Blackjack
Blackjack terminal game as the final project for CS101 at Codeacademy

The code has been rewritten to be simpler, shorter, faster and more readable. It also now supports multiple hands.
The necessary modules for the new version are Cards.py, Decks.py, Hands.py, Players.py and Game.py.
The game runs on Game.py.

To run the game, cd into the directory where you have cloned this repo, and run the Game.py file with
the command `python3 Game.py`.

Enjoy!
